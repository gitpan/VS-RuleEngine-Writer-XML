NAME
    VS::RuleEngine::Writer::XML - Store VS::RuleEngine engine declarations
    as XML

SYNOPSIS
      use VS::RuleEngine::Writer::XML;
      
  my $xml = VS::RuleEngine::Writer::XML->as_xml($engine);
      
  VS::RuleEngine::Loader::XML->to_file($engine, "my_engine.xml");

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a mean to write VS::RuleEngine engine declarations
    to XML.

INTERFACE
  CLASS METHODS
    as_xml ( ENGINE )
        Returns a XML-representation of *ENGINE*

    to_file ( ENGINE, PATH )
        Creates a XML-representation of *ENGINE* and saves it at *PATH*.

XML Document structure
    The structure of the XML created by this writer is described in "XML
    Document structure" in VS::RuleEngine::Loader::XML.

    Arguments to entities (actions, inputs, hooks, outputs and rules) will
    be tested to see if it's a single hash reference and if so be written as
    such using the key as element name and the value as the elements text
    content.

    However, if the implementing class of the entitiy implements the method
    "process_xml_writers_args" this will be called as a class method and is
    responsible for adding children to the element. The arguments to the
    method are the document as a "XML::LibXML::Document"-instance, the
    entity-element as "XML::LibXML::Element"-instance which to add children
    to and a list of the arguments encapsulated by
    "VS::RuleEngine::TypeDecl"-instance that represents the entity.
